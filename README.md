# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using Python 

In this I have performed Customer Segmentation on the 'Online Retail' dataset using K-means clustering algorithm. 

Project includes - 

1) Understanding the fields of the dataset.
- There are 5,41,909 entries in the dataset each with 8 fields/features.
- Features are : InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.

2) Data Cleaning
- Removing missing values
- Removing unnecessary entries (which do not account to anything or are not related to our necessity)

3) Visualization of data to gain Insights
- Bar graphs

4) Determining customer segments - The code segments are determined according to the three following attributes (RFM Model)
- Recency
- Frequency
- Monetary value

5) Data Preprocessing 
- Standardization
- Transformation

6) Determining optimum number of clusters using
- Elbow Method
- Silhouette score 

7) Data visualization with optimum number of clusters

8) Customer segmentation = drawing insights
